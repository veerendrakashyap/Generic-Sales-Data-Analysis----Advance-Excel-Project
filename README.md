## Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze sales data from a generic store and create an interactive dashboard using Microsoft Excel. The project involved cleaning and processing raw data, performing key analytical computations, and visualizing the results in an intuitive format. This end-to-end process showcases how Excel can be leveraged for data analysis and business intelligence.

## Project Description

The dataset used in this project contained raw transactional data, including sales figures, product details, and customer information. To extract meaningful insights, I performed data cleaning and transformation steps before diving into analysis. Once the data was structured correctly, I built an interactive dashboard that allows users to filter and explore key metrics dynamically.

### Step-by-Step Process

- Data Cleaning


-- Imported the raw dataset into Excel.


-- Identified and handled missing or inconsistent values.


-- Standardized data formats to maintain consistency.


-- Removed duplicate entries and irrelevant information.

- Data Processing


-- Structured the data using appropriate tabular formats.


-- Created additional calculated fields where necessary.


-- Applied lookup functions to consolidate relevant data.

- Data Analysis


-- Used Excel formulas and functions to derive key metrics.


-- Created pivot tables to summarize sales performance, customer trends, and product insights.


-- Applied conditional formatting to highlight important values.

- Dashboard Creation


-- Designed a user-friendly layout for an interactive dashboard.


-- Added charts, graphs, and slicers to enable data filtering.


-- Ensured the dashboard was dynamic and responsive to user interactions.

# Conclusion

This project provided a comprehensive understanding of the data analysis process using Excel. By working with real-world sales data, I demonstrated skills in data cleaning, transformation, and visualization. The final interactive dashboard offers a valuable tool for business decision-making, making complex data accessible and actionable.
